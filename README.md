## Getting and Cleaning Data-Project ##
>Author: Patricia Gonzales
>The purpose of this project is to create a tidy data set that can be used later for analysis. A CodeBook.md and a Readme.md files have been provided as well.
>The tidy data comes from the course website and it represents data collected from the accelometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
>The run_analysis.R script does the following:
>1. Merges the training and test sets to greate one dat set (merged_data)
>2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
>3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in th data set.
>4. Appropriately labels the data set with the descriptive variable names.
>5. Creates an independent tidy data set (tidy_data.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
